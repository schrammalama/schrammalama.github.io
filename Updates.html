	<p><strong>Playstation Vita</strong></p>
	<p>I just bought at PS Vita from ebay, I used to have a PS Vita but I sold it which is a huge regret of mine so I finaly am getting a new one. I was going to buy it at Video game wizards but it was way to hot outside. Just like any online purchace I am worried about it not being as advertised specificly it had a picture of a memory card but it wasn't in the description and I need the card to do anything on it espesialy hack it which is the first thing I'm gonna do. I also have a USB charger and an SD2Vita coming so I don't need the memory card it's just there to hack it.</p>

	<p ><strong>New iPad</strong></p>
	<p>I recently got an iPad Mini 4th gen, my dad was going to throw it out because he thought it was broken, but I fixed it up and the only thing that isn't woking is touch ID. I also set it up using duet display to be a portable monitor to my mac book when I'm out and about. Sadly it isn't working properly with my windows PC.</p>
